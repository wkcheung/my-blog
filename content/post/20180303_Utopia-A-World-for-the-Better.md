In this recent year, I suddenly have this strong sense of purpose, that I need to make the world a better place. I know, it sounds so cheesy. But I sincerely feel this urge in me. I guess such thought comes from my time in Denmark, or that in comparison with my experience in Hong Kong.

"Danes are the happiest people in the world," everyone told me after they knew I am going on an exchange in Denmark, "and they are really good looking." After three months in Denmark, I could say I bore witness of that.

Despite all their physical advantages, they are really friendly and extremely helpful (Can you imagine such people exist?). And they smile a lot. If you tried to smile to a stranger in Hong Kong, they'd think you are crazy. Hong Kongers are stressful, and miserable. This can be proven in many restaurants in Hong Kong by the grumpy faces on the waiters.

Getting back to my cheesy thought, I guess staying in Denmark makes me feel there is a better world *somewhere else*. I realized that a better place does exist and the main difference is that people are happier there. The question is: *how to make people happier?*

I recalled the decisions I have made and rethought how they could contribute to the grand goal of "making the world a better place". I started with what I had spent most of my time on: what I study, Computer Engineering.

From the Industrial Revolution to the rising of tech giants like Apple and Google, we can tell technology is the driving force of human civilization. Undoubtedly, we are enjoying the juicy fruits these movements produce. However, after reading [The Utopia Project: Can Silicon Valley Fix the Future?](https://medium.com/financial-times/the-utopia-project-can-silicon-valley-fix-the-future-94d8475b3e1d), the fact that we are living in a "surveillance-style advertising-based ecosystem" was like a slap in the face. As computer science students, we are so obsessed with big data and machine learning. We tried so hard to extract data from users and analyze them from every angle. Then, we pushed the "best" result to them and felt satisfied.

*Is this actually moral?*

To be honest, I don't have the answer. And actually, my plan for my final year project may involve data mining. If there is one thing I am sure about, it would be: this trend is unstoppable.

> Google’s market share for search is higher in Europe than in the US, suggesting that users are not — yet — as alarmed as Keen by “surveillance capitalism”.

It is horrifying to watch *Black Mirror*. It is even more horrifying to realize *we are living in the world of Black Mirror*.

The book mentioned in the article, *How to Fix the Future*, suggests that we can return to the original vision of the internet as a decentralised and empowering repository of knowledge by adopting better policies.

> Keen encapsulates the values he seeks to promote as More’s Law, based on the work of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century author of Utopia. Keen suggests that today’s internet companies, which are all too familiar with the other Moore’s Law (derived from Gordon Moore’s observation that the number of transistors on an integrated chip doubles every two years), desperately need to reacquaint themselves with More’s humanist verities.

I am not sure if Keen's hope can be achieved in the future. But it is a powerful reminder that: *as someone who is educated and able to make a difference in the world, think of humans first*. By saying that, I mean we should plan our future to be a humanity-advanced society instead of a merely technology-advanced one. As an engineer, I have my share of responsibility on this (I hope it doesn't sound too ideal and optimistic, or cheesy). This is about technology, things that construct our future, the products we are building now. If we narrow our scope down, it is not difficult to see that we should have one more checkbox on QC: *how does this product make a better world?*.
