## Carrie & Lowell by Sufjan Stevens

One of my favorite albums of recent years.

Thanks to Spotify auto play, I was fortunate enough to hear one of the songs from the album, Fourth of July. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, but then the lyrics, "We're all gonna die", just keeps on continuously, unstoppably playing in my head. It wasn't the annoying kind of songs that got stuck in your head (Don't think about "Baby"). It was something deeper. I knew I had to listen to the whole album and chew on every word of the songs, or else I would be haunted by it for the rest of the week.

Then I finally got some time to listen to the songs and study the lyrics. It was even more heartbreaking and darker than "We're all gonna die".

Written extremely personally, Sufjan Stevens has stripped himself bare to weave a memorial for his mother, Carrie. It had not been a healthy relationship: Carrie had left her children when they were little. She suffered from schizophrenia and depression, and was a drug addict and an alcoholic. On this, Stevens told Pitchfork, "it was in our best interest for our mother to abandon us."

```
When I was three,
three maybe four,
she left us at the video store
```

Through this record, Stevens tries to be back in peace and forgive. After Carrie died of stomach cancer, Stevens had abused drugs and alcohol for the seek of being intimate with his mother, by repeating her pattern of destruction.
