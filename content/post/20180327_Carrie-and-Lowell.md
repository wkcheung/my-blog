## Carrie & Lowell by Sufjan Stevens

One of my favorite albums of recent years.

Thanks to Spotify auto play, I was fortunate enough to hear one of the songs from the album, *Fourth of July*. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, but then there is a verse, *"We're all gonna die..."*, just keeps on continuously, unstoppably playing in my head. It wasn't the annoying kind of songs that got stuck in your head (Don't think about *Baby*). It was something deeper. I knew I had to listen to the whole album and chew on every word of the songs or I would be haunted by it for the rest of the week.

After listening to the songs, I found the album was even more heartbreaking and darker than the fact *"We're all gonna die"*.

Written extremely personally, Sufjan Stevens has stripped himself bare to weave a memorial for his mother, Carrie. It had not been a healthy relationship: Carrie had left her children when they were little. She suffered from schizophrenia and depression, and was a drug addict and an alcoholic. On this, Stevens told Pitchfork, "it was in our best interest for our mother to abandon us."

> When I was three,

> three maybe four,

> she left us at the video store

After Carrie died of stomach cancer, Stevens had abused drugs and alcohol for the seek of being intimate with his mother, by repeating her pattern of destruction. Through this record, Stevens tries to be back in peace, and to forgive.

*Fourth of July*, which is the song with the verse "We're all gonna die", moves me deeply with its soft vocal and devastating meaning. The lyrics sound so loving, yet I don't think that was the actual conversation Sufjan had with his mother on her deathbed. Instead, I believe those were words Sufjan wanted to hear so desperately from his mother.

> Did you get enough love, my little dove?

> Why do you cry?

> And Iâ€™m sorry I left, but it was for the best

> Though it never felt right

> My little Versailles.

I sincerely suggest this album to you, *Carrie & Lowell*.
