      <description>Carrie &amp;amp; Lowell by Sufjan Stevens One of my favorite albums of recent years.
Thanks to Spotify auto play, I was fortunate enough to hear one of the songs from the album, Fourth of July. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to it at first, but then there is a verse, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re all gonna die&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, just keeps on continuously, unstoppably playing in my head. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the annoying kind of songs that got stuck in your head (Don&amp;rsquo;t think about Baby).</description>
